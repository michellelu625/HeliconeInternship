# Helicone Internship Projects – AI & API Prototypes

This repository contains a set of Python projects developed during my internship at **Helicone**, focused on building and experimenting with AI-powered applications, API integrations, and user-facing interfaces. The work emphasizes practical interaction with large language models (LLMs), external APIs, and GUI-based user experiences.

## Overview

These projects explore how AI systems can be integrated into real applications—from conversational interfaces to data-driven tools—while maintaining clarity, modularity, and explainability in the codebase.

The repository includes both **console-based** and **GUI-based** applications, with detailed inline documentation explaining design decisions, logic flow, and API usage.

## Project Highlights

### AI Chat Interface (Console-Based)
- Built an interactive chat loop powered by the OpenAI API  
- Implemented prompt processing, response generation, and exit handling  
- Tuned generation parameters such as temperature, token limits, and stopping conditions  
- Demonstrates understanding of LLM behavior, prompt-response flow, and user input normalization

### Weather Information Tool (GUI-Based)
- Developed a desktop GUI using `tkinter`  
- Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data  
- Parsed and transformed JSON responses into user-friendly outputs  
- Performed temperature conversions and displayed contextual information with icons and emojis  
- Designed event-driven interactions (keyboard bindings, UI updates)

### API Integration & Data Handling
- Constructed HTTP requests using `requests`  
- Parsed nested JSON data structures  
- Converted raw API responses into structured, readable formats  
- Demonstrated error-aware data extraction and transformation

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Python application development  
- REST API integration  
- Large Language Model (LLM) usage and prompt engineering  
- GUI development with `tkinter`  
- JSON parsing and data transformation  
- Modular function design and readable code documentation  
- User input handling and control flow design  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenAI API  
- OpenWeatherMap API  
- `requests`  
- `tkinter`  
- Unicode / emoji rendering  

## Notes

- API keys shown in example files are placeholders or were used in controlled development environments  
- In production settings, keys should be stored securely using environment variables  
- These projects were built as prototypes and learning-focused implementations rather than production systems

## Context

This work was completed as part of my internship at Helicone and reflects hands-on experience experimenting with AI-driven systems, external APIs, and user-facing software design. The repository demonstrates my ability to quickly learn new tools, reason about system behavior, and translate abstract APIs into tangible applications.
